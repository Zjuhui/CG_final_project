# CG_final_project

没来及做更好的整理，目前只是把最后项目的全部代码放了进去，其中包含一些平时的课后作业，当然，也有一些库没放进去，例如glew，这些可以去learnopengl上去自行下载，实在抱歉。

I haven't had time to organize it better yet, so I've only included all the code from the final project for now. This also contains some regular homework assignments. Of course, there are also some libraries that I haven't included, such as GLEW, which can be downloaded from LearnOpenGL. Thanks.

当时使用的ide是 VS2022

The ide I used that time is VS2022.

仓促记于2024.10.23，后续有空再整理参考代码、库以及其他一些文件等，感谢浏览。

Hastily noted on October 23, 2024. I will organize the reference code, libraries, and other files later when I have more time. Thank you for viewing.
